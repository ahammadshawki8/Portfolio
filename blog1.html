                <p class="lead">What I always say is that “Programming is neither so difficult nor too easy”. So, for
                    learning programming, you don’t need to have much merit but you need to have a good amount of
                    potential and passion towards programming like, “Yes, I have an interest in programming and I will
                    learn that.”</p>

                <p class="lead">I guess I had the same feeling at the beginning. I was so influenced to see a quote in
                    my textbook saying, ”Most of the students waste their time by playing video games or doing social
                    networking in their past-time, but some special students among them learn about programming in their
                    school life and add a new skill to their skillset.” I just wanted to be the special one. From then,
                    I determined to be a self-taught programmer.</p>

                            <p class="lead">I always make my decisions very carefully. So before learning to code, I
                                browsed online and discovered that Python is not only the best language to learn but
                                also it is easy and beginner-friendly. So, I started learning about programming with
                                Python.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Since there are no shortcuts for success I searched for the longest youtube
                                course on Python. After successfully completing Microsoft Virtual Academy’s (MVA) <a
                                    target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHxoh9Rrtdk">“Python Zero to
                                    Hero”</a> course in 3 months, I learned the basics of Python programming. This
                                course is very helpful for beginners.</p>

                    </div>
                </article>



                <p class="lead">After that, I thought that I learned everything about programming, and for that, I keep
                    a distance from it for almost 2 months. But then, I realized that we should never stop learning. So,
                    I subscribed to some popular youtube channels that make good python videos. Some of them are:</p>

                                well as sharpened my previous Python knowledge. At the same time, I read a book on
                                Python which is written in my native language. My suggestion is that everyone must read
                                a programming book in their native language first as it will help them to understand the
                                basic concepts of programming clearly. Then, I read an English book on Python

                                    Notes for Professionals”</a> which covers almost every topic of Python. I also
                                cultivated a good habit of reading documentations. Believe me, It helps a lot.</p>
