            <p class="lead">During the Corona outbreak, my school was closed for about 5 months. At that time, while I
                was feeling bored sitting in front of my desk, suddenly an idea banged into my head. I thought my
                classmates might be bored too. Why don't I talk with them and teach them programming? Then I discussed
                my idea with some of them. All appreciated the idea and they were eagerly wanting to learn to program.
                So, I organized PyCampaign20 in Zoom. In this campaign, I have guided them on how to start a career as a
                Python Developer and I also taught them the Basics of Python Programming. The mentoring project was
                produced by The AS8 organization. After completing a successful online campaign, my friends were like

                            it saved me from starting my programming career in the wrong way. Then it saved my tons of
                            productive time which I might waste in search of quality videos, books, links, etc. We
                            didn't have world-class facilities here but our enthusiastic instructor Ahammad helped us
                            with his best. Now at the end of the Campaign, I have Python programming skills in my
                            skill-set and a proper coding plan for my next 3 years.</p>

                            YouTube. I became a tech-nerd in 8 grade and started to get interested in the software of
                            technological devices. At that time, Ahammad taught me about Python in school. At first, I
                            didn't pay attention to programming but later I got interested in it. So, I asked him if he
                            could teach me more. He gave me the link to his repository in which he had written about the
                            "Python Basics" and the repository was so great. I got inspired by that and started my
                            coding journey with Python. And he is still helping me in my coding whenever I have
                            confusion about something.</p>
