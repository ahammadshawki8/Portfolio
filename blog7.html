                <p class="lead">Most of us find it easy to live in our comfort zone when it comes to our careers. We
                    generally go to our workplace, interact with members of our team, collaborate when needed, then come
                    back home. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, we can certainly get the job done - but we
                    should do more when it comes to expanding our career.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Over the last two decades, as developers have become essential across
                                industries, more places for developers to connect have started to spring up. Both online
                                and in-person forums have risen to solve problems, create learning opportunities, and
                                encourage networking. You will be able to find a user group or community for about every
                                major, modern programming language, or technological topic. The word “Community” does
                                not necessarily mean your co-workers, it can be your friends, your mentors, your
                                teammates, classmates, the people you follow on social media, or the people who follow
                                you in or even your family members. Community is the place from where we get motivation,
                                inspiration, ideas from our future projects. And it is the place where we showcase our
                                projects and achievements and at the end of the day get appreciation. It plays a major
                                role in the development of a developer, in whatever technology they are working on, a
                                supportive community can still be your key to success. In a community, developers
                                generally meet in their off-hours to discuss what’s new in their language of choice,
                                challenges they’ve encountered, and different ways of doing things. If you’ve never been
                                to one of these groups, it might be easy to brush them off as an unimportant outlet
                                where people talk in way too much detail about a geeky interest. Instead, most of the
                                attendees are professionals who are looking to build skills and find new ways to solve
                                problems.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Why do we sacrifice our personal time to discuss the things we do all day at
                                work? Simply put, it makes us better programmers today than we were in yesterday. When I
                                attend a meetup or talk, even on topics that only have a small overlap with the code, I
                                always learn something new. Online developer communities like Stack Overflow, social
                                networks, blogs, and open-source resources have become a place for developers to meet,
                                improve, and share code without being in the same office. Again, in-person offline
                                events including meet-ups, contests, and conferences provide more personal relationship
                                building, learning, career development, and networking opportunities. These various
                                communities allow developers to expand their horizon of knowledge regardless of their
                                level of experience and join conversations that wouldn’t be possible inside their
                                existing role at their workplaces.</p>

                            <p class="lead">The best way to get involved is by seeking out opportunities to learn. Every
                                platform within the developer community offers unique openings for education. If you
                                have a problem you need to solve, a project that you are working on, or a new
                                programming language you want to learn, there’s a good chance you’ll find assistance
                                through others in your field. Most of the developers in these communities are very
                                helpful. Dive into a topic you’re interested in and go from there. Once you get
                                involved, you’ll find an automatic expansion of your network and opportunities. Online
                                platforms not only help you gain a better understanding of your skills but also allow
                                you to help others solve their problem. You might have a broad idea of how something
                                works, but teaching allows you to break it down and truly understand it from the
                                foundation. Again, when people try to teach a particular topic to someone, they always
                                think about how they can explain the topic in an easier way so that the learner can
                                understand it better. Searching for an easier explanation not only helps the learners
                                but also helps the instructor as the instructor learns the old topic from a new
                                perspective. Some popular online communities are:</p>

                                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is created as a
                                microblogging social platform where you can share your ideas and info in 140 characters.
                                But recently, it has become one of the most active developer communities on the
                                internet. On Twitter, you will find amazing developers sharing their ideas, codes,
                                projects, tips and also helping others by publishing eBooks, blog posts, long threads,
                                video contents, and even you can find job opportunities and invitations to lots of
                                amazing events via Twitter. I think each developer on Twitter is a bundle of motivation.
                                They really inspire and motivate beginners to do better in their careers.

                                Great for answering those questions that aren’t coming up through Google search, and if
                                you’re running into a problem, others likely are too. Writing about it allows a story to
                                be told behind the code, rather than just a question-answer forum like Stack Overflow.
                                You may have to spend hours working on that problem, but ultimately you look like an
                                expert when you provide the solution. So, you can write a blog post about that
                                particular problem and its solution and help others who are facing the same problem.
                                There are so many platforms where you can publish your blog post like <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.hashnode.com">HashNode</a>, <a target="_blank"

                                start blogging, but they don’t know where to start. I think If you want to learn how to
                                swim, you have to dive into the water. Likewise, if you want to learn how to blog, you

                                Open source allows you to contribute to existing repositories, potentially meet the
                                people who wrote them and discuss them at in-person events. There are many platforms
                                that provide the opportunity of contributing to open-source like <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> and <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.gitlab.com">GitLab</a>. Contributing to or creating repositories
                                is also a great way to get visibility for your company’s brand or your personal brand as
                                a developer. If you maintain a repository, others will likely point out bugs and bring
                                elements of the code to your attention that you didn’t previously realize were awkward
                                or clunky. In this process, you will learn how to write effective code and also know
                                some best practices. Open-Source is great because it helps you to get yourself out of
                                your comfort zone and gives you multiple chances to meet more developers where you can
                                find opportunities to learn while building relationships.

                    For networking in smaller groups, meet-ups can often bring together people who do similar work but
                    for different companies. These events build a real sense of community and can be found for free
                    online. You can often enjoy great conversation, free swags, and informative talks with people who
                    have similar interests. After going to a few events, you’ll probably notice that many people are
                    attending these meetups who have attended before other meetups. Over time you will build
                    relationships with these people and continue to have discussions, like getting a fresh perspective
                    on solving your latest problem or discovering which companies are hiring.

                    Another way to join the developer community is through conferences. They are particularly helpful if
                    you’re new to the industry. Now in the pandemic period, there are many virtual conferences and
                    webinars you can be a part of. You can even work as a volunteer to get involved with the event from
                    the beginning, seeing how it comes together from the ground up. When you attend, you’ll have the
                    opportunity to meet developers from different cities or countries and be exposed to a vast amount of
                    new knowledge from speakers. Chat with vendors, attend networking events, and hear keynotes on
                    subjects related to your field all while expanding your network. You never know how a relationship
                    can pay off in the future if it’s maintained after the event.

                                speaking. If speaking is something you enjoy, start at smaller local meet-ups and work
                                your way up to larger conferences, and eventually be paid to attend. This can be a great
                                way to establish yourself as an authority in your field, travel, and attend events

                                opportunities to meet with other developers around the world. There are many platforms
                                where you can solve coding problems like CodeForces, CodeChef, Hackerrank, Project
                                Euler, etc. These platforms also organize coding contests every month. Again, there are
                                few platforms like MLH which organize many hackathon-related events throughout the year.
                                There are some special competitive programming events which are held once a year. Some

                <p class="lead">Ultimately, the best way to get involved with the developer community is to find
                    something that interests you, work on it, and share it with others. If you like helping people solve
                    problems, find forums and communities that allow you to do so. Or if you want to share the backstory
                    on a piece of code, write a blog. It’s often as simple as finding something that you think could be
                    better and trying to solve it. By creating and contributing to the developer community you are
                    sharing our knowledge and that always pays off. The developer community becomes stronger through
                    collaboration. The more involved you are, the more people you connect with. Those relationships
                    ultimately return that support in the future through problem-solving, knowledge sharing, or job
                    opportunities.</p>

                                schools and universities across the world, particularly for those whose schools have
                                closed early due to the current situation. My school was closed from March 16. It’s
                                completely surreal and dissatisfying. At that time, I was just left wondering, “What am
                                I supposed to do now?”<br>

                            <p class="card-text">What I always say is that “Programming is neither so difficult nor too
                                easy”. So, for learning programming, you don’t need too much merit but you need to have
                                much potential and passion for programming like, “Yes, I love programming and I will
                                learn that.” In this blog, I have described my timelines of learning Python programming.
                                I hope you will be benefitted too if you follow my route.<br>
