                    methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural
                    and unstructured data.” It is related to data mining, machine learning, and big data. It is all
                    about problem-solving, exploration, and extracting valuable information from data. To do so
                    effectively, you’ll need to wrangle datasets, train machine learning models, visualize results, and
                    much more.</p>

                            <p class="lead">Data science hype is all over the world now. It has been around for quite a
                                while but its relevance is still as high as ever. Why should you enter the field of Data
                                Science “right now”? Well, there are several reasons. My favorite reason for entering
                                the field of Data science is because it is very interesting. You can see things from a
                                different angle and predict the future and take crucial decisions. Being a data
                                scientist practically means you can solve really complex problems and break them down
                                into very simple bits so everyone around you can understand and find ways around. This
                                can be done when one keeps an open mind and reaches out to the creative person within.
                                Besides this, Data science is a rapidly growing field because of the powerful impact it
                                brings to companies. The demand for data scientists has skyrocketed over the last few
                                years but the supply for good and quality Data scientists is increasing at a much slower
                                pace. <a target="_blank"

                            <p class="lead">After knowing the impact of Data Science in the tech industries as well as
                                the world, the very first question which bangs into everybody’s mind is that where
                                should we start? Well, the answer is <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Python is the best language for Data
                                Science for a good amount of reasons. Simplicity is one of Python's greatest strengths.
                                Thanks to its precise and efficient syntax, Python can accomplish the same tasks with
                                less code than other languages. This makes implementing solutions refreshingly fast.
                                Besides, Python has an all-star lineup of libraries and frameworks for data analysis and
                                machine learning, which drastically reduces the time it takes to produce results. And
                                the good news is that Python, as a programming language, is so easy to learn that if you
                                have a job, you can learn it in six months just by spending 1 hour a day in your
                                pastime. And if you are a student, then why are you wasting your time on social
                                networks? Understanding Python is the most valuable skills needed for a Data Science
                                career.</p>

                            <p class="lead">So, first, you need to learn the basics of Python. I have another blog about
                                <a href="blog1.html">“How I have become a Self-Taught Python Developer in 3 years?”</a>
                                I hope if you read the blog you will have a good idea about where to start and where to
                                end. People who have followed my Python learning timelines are highly benefitted. </p>

                <p class="lead">After learning the basics of Python, you need to learn about some Python libraries and
                    frameworks. As we mentioned earlier, Python has an all-star lineup of libraries for data science.
                    Libraries are simply bundling of pre-existing functions and objects that you can import into your
                    script to save time. The libraries you will need are:</p>

                <p class="lead tab">
                    • NumPy <br>
                    • Scipy <br>
                    • Pandas <br>
                    • Matplotlib <br>
                </p>

                <p class="lead">NumPy and Pandas are great for exploring and playing with data. Matplotlib is a data
                    visualization library that makes graphs as you’d find in Excel or Google Sheets. In this blog, I
                    will tell you how to learn these libraries and from where you will find good learning resources.</p>

                    Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning you need to learn some additional Python libraries like
                    Scikit Learn, Tensor flow, Keras, Pytorch, OpenCV, etc. That will be a talk for my upcoming blog

                                easy”. So, for learning programming, you don’t need too much merit but you need to have
                                much potential and passion for programming like, “Yes, I love programming and I will
                                learn that.” In this blog, I have described my timelines of learning Python programming.
                                I hope you will be benefitted too if you follow my route.<br>
